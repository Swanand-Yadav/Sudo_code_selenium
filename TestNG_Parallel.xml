	thread-count: It means we can allow up-to specific number of thread should execute in parallel
				  execution. If our thread-count is 1 then this execution becomes under sequential 
				  execution not parallel because they are using same thread utilization. And if we 
				  are not using hole thread-count parameter then by-default it takes as parallel
				  execution if we mentioned only parallel. And if we mention greater than 1 & 
				  positive number thread-count it means it going to execute in parallel mode.
				  
	We can use parallel execution only in suite or test level in XML file only not class level
	
	<suite name="Test" parallel="tests" thread-count="2"> 
		 Above line saying that it can run tests parallel it means it will consider only tests not
		 any specifically classes or methods or any... In above code there are two tests and allowing 
		 with 2 thread-count so one tests will take one thread id another will take second thread id 
		 because we are take at suit level so it focus only on tests(parallel value maybe different 
		 i.e. tests,methods or classes). If we take it at tests level  then it will focus only 
		 classes(parallel value maybe different i.e. tests,methods or classes).
		 
		 <suite name="Test" parallel="tests" thread-count="2"> -> all tests from suite
		 <suite name="Test" parallel="classes" thread-count="2"> -> all classes from suite
		 
		 <test name="Test1" parallel="classes" thread-count="2"> -> all classes from test
		 <test name="Test1" parallel="methods" thread-count="2"> -> all methods from test
		 
		 Important: If you are executing at suite level and parallel value having classes
		 			and thread-count=2 then total_thread =(number of test*thread-count) not a how many
		 			thread-count is displaying. In that scenario tests are executing sequentially but
		 			inside thread are executing parallel
